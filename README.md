## Our Mission
Our mission is to provide opportunities for kids worldwide to build a foundation for their future by engaging in free educational activities powered by state of the art e-Learning technologies.

Our vision is to leverage technology to provide access to free educational support to every child around the globe. We have constructed an on-line portal where students across the globe can access variety of free eLearning materials.

We know that knowledge and education are the basics of economic opportunity. Giving children access to basic education from a young age is critical for the success of any country. We believe the biggest impact can be made by augmenting school activities with powerful e-Learning technologies. We partner with schools in developing countries to leverage existing facilities and equipment to provide students with our educational platform.
